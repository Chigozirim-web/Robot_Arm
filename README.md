# Robot_Arm

 Using the make_scara_robot as a reference, I was able to create my own robot(my_robot1) which, in its simplest form, is a robot arm (without the fingers).
I visualized my robot arm on paper initially by drawing it and that made it easier to create.

The links(objects) were created first, and then connected via joints which either rotated or translated, or were fixed.

Then the various animations were applied for the robot arm to move in a 3d space.
